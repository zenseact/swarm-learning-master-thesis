    "# The basics of the ML platform\n",
    "This ML platform is a highly capable and customisable tool for building and training machine learning models. It takes a configuration object with various parameters, such as data location, image size, model type, and loss function, to simplify the process of building and training models. The platform can be used for central and decentralized training and allows access to data without running any training. The platform makes it easy to build and train machine learning models with minimal coding and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will go through the basics of the platform. We will start by importing the platform and creating a configuration object. We will then use the configuration object to create a dataset and a model. We will then train the model and evaluate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The configuration object\n",
    "The configuration object is a dictionary that contains all the parameters needed to build and train a model. The configuration object is passed to the platform when creating a dataset, a model, or when training a model. The configuration object is also stored so that it can be used to reproduce the results.\n",
