    <h1>Towards Federated Fleet Learning Using Unannotated Data</h1>
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>This project is the outcome of our Master's thesis at Zenseact, where we delved into the emerging field of
        Federated Learning (FL) within the context of autonomous driving. The research primarily tackled the challenge
        of using scarce or non-existent labelled data, a major shift from the prevailing assumption of having copious
        amounts of labelled data.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Our findings underscored the compelling potential of FL in autonomous driving, especially when the methods
        leverage on-vehicle generated labels or utilise semi-supervised or unsupervised learning approaches. Despite the
        complexity of the problem we addressed, our work provided valuable insights and contributed to a broader
        understanding of applying FL in the autonomous driving domain.</p>
