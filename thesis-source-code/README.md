# Source Code Overview
The source code underpinning our thesis comprises two distinct parts. First, there is the platform directory, which contains a Python package that was used to generate the results presented in our thesis. The platform directory houses our primary implementation, including support for road-segmentation.

In contrast, the source directory contains a working implementation of Holistic Path.

The presence of these two different implementations stems from our way of working.

It's important to note that throughout our documentation and code, any reference to "Holistic Path" is synonymous with "Trajectory Prediction" as used in our thesis.

For a detailed understanding of the different implementations, please refer to the README.md files located within their respective directories.
